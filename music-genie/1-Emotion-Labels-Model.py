# MAGIC ### Choosing a model that can label our songs and user input with emotions
# MAGIC To get started, we need to choose a model that can take an input of song lyrics or a user statement like "I spilled my coffee all over my shirt", and label that input with some emotions. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For this project, the model we choose should meet a few requirements:
# MAGIC 1. We want it to be an open-source model that anyone can use without requiring access tokens
# MAGIC 2. We want it to accept enough tokens that it can digest the song lyric inputs
# MAGIC 3. We want to use a model off the shelf that does not require additional training beyond few-shot learning
# MAGIC 4. We want to use a lightweight model that does not require significant compute power (e.g. no GPUs required!)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Given these requirements, we can go a few routes: 
# MAGIC - explore text-generation models like Llama and MPT
# MAGIC - explore fill-mask models
# MAGIC
# MAGIC After considering our options, let's test out some fill-mask models.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Great! Clicking on the experiment opens up the Experiments UI. Navigate to the Evlauation tab and select "Group by: song_title" and "Compare: result" to view a list of the songs whose lyrics we tested, and the outputs of each prompt. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC When we compare the results, it's clear that the "Basic" prompt isn't going to be very helpful. The word "good" appears often, across songs that differ emotionally.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The other three options give us much more interesting results, and it's here that some human judgement will come into play. For this project, we'll select the "FEEL_THE_EMOTION_OF" prompt, with the masking prompt "These lyrics give me the emotion of <'mask>:"
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Based on these results, we can use our chosen prompt to label the song lyrics in our table with emotions.

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Great! Now we have our song lyrics labeled with the emotions they inspire. In order to compare these emotions to those of our app users, we need to convert the text into embeddings in order to perform vector search. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This process worked well for labeling our existing database of songs. We will want to set up a pipeline to run this process for all new data if we plan to add more songs in the future.
# MAGIC  
# MAGIC The next step is to host our mask-fill model behind an endpoint, so that we can label user input with emotions as it comes in through our web app. Let's do that as the final step in this notebook.
